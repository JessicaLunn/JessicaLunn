            <h2>Sofware Engineer's Portfolio Re-design</h2>
            <p>A software engineer impressed by my artwork on Instagram, proposed that I re-design his portfolio. The project let me apply my illustrative talents to animation and kickstart my journey with Figma, whilist learning the basics of VS Code, Git & Github. Understanding the customers requirements, I independetely innovated an animation of a banana peeling as his website landing page.</p>

            <h2>Little Lemon Restaurant</h2>
            <p>Following a UI/UX design course with Meta, I achieved a grade of 91% and recieved a certification accredited by Meta. The course culminated in a project to design a mobile app for a restaurant, adhering strictly to the design brief, which included the development of user personas and journey maps. This project significantly enhanced my confidence in using Figma and deepened my understanding of UI/UX principles, especially usability testing.</p>

            <h2>Simply Hi Vis Clothing UK</h2>
            <p>After the course, I took on the redesign of a website for a PPE retailer in Bournemouth. I crafted a high-fidelity prototype in Figma, carefully aligning with the client's specifications while applying my UI/UX knowledge. This project affirmed my ability to improve user experience and branding for e-commerce sites.</p>
