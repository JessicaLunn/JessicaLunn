        <section class="introduction">
            <p>Moving from traditional illustration to UI/UX design, I've developed a keen interest in crafting user-focused digital experiences. This portfolio is a reflection of that transition, presenting projects that marry artistic skill with digital design acumen. I'm actively seeking full-time UI/UX roles where I can refine my skills and contribute to cutting-edge design work.</p>

            <h2>Jack Simms Software Engineering Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I embarked on web design when a software engineering graduate, impressed by my artwork on Instagram, invited me to co-design his portfolio. The project let me apply my illustrative talents to animation and kickstart my journey with Figma. I designed an animation of a banana peeling as his website landing page, per his request.</p>

            </video>
            <p>Jack was thoroughly impressed with the outcome, and frankly, so was I. This project underscored my potential in web design, steering me towards a professional path in this field.</p>

            <h2>Little Lemon Restaurant (Meta Course Project)</h2>
            <p> I pursued a UI/UX design course with Meta. With top marks in my coursework and an overall distinction, I received a Meta-certified diploma. The main project involved designing a mobile app for a restaurant, strictly following the design brief, which included developing user personas and journey maps. It was a significant boost to my confidence in using Figma and understanding UI/UX principles, particularly usability testing.</p>

            <h2>Simply Hi Vis Clothing UK</h2>
            <p>After the course, I took on the redesign of a website for a PPE retailer in Bournemouth. I crafted a high-fidelity prototype in Figma, carefully aligning with the client's specifications while applying my UI/UX knowledge. This project affirmed my ability to improve user experience and branding for e-commerce sites.</p>

            <p>The project was a triumph, receiving high praise from the owners. The new web store is currently in development and will soon be operational.</p>
