        <section class="introduction">
            <p>Transitioning from traditional illustration to UI/UX design, I have discovered a passion for creating engaging, user-centred digital experiences. This portfolio is a testament to my journey, showcasing projects that blend artistic flair with technical proficiency in web design. I am keen to explore full-time opportunities in UI/UX, further honing my skills and contributing to innovative design solutions.</p>

            <h2>Jack Simms Software Engineering Portfolio</h2>
            <p>My journey into Web Design began when a recent Software Engineering graduate, impressed by my artwork on Instagram, requested my collaboration in designing his portfolio site. This project allowed me to utilise my illustration skills in animation and to begin learning Figma for prototyping, leading to a final design he could code to. His unique requirement was the incorporation of bananas, a nod to his recent conference talk.</p>

            <p>Jack was very impressed by my work, and so was I! Completing this made it obvious they I should look into pursuing a career in web design.</p>

            <h2>Little Lemon Restaurant (Meta Course Project)</h2>
            <p>Following the fulfilling experience with Jack Simms's portfolio, I enrolled in a UI/UX design course by Meta. Achieving 100% in my coursework and 91% overall, I earned a certificate accredited by Meta. The coursework involved designing a mobile app for a restaurant, adhering to specific design requirements including creating user personas and stories. This project enhanced my confidence in Figma and UI/UX principles, including usability testing.</p>

            <h2>Simply Hi Vis Clothing UK</h2>
            <p>Post-course completion, I redesigned a website for a Bournemouth-based PPE manufacturer. I developed a high-fidelity prototype using Figma, balancing customer specifications with my UI/UX expertise. This project validated my skills in enhancing usability and branding for e-commerce platforms.</p>

            <p>The project was a triumph, receiving high praise from the owners. The new web store is currently in development and will soon be operational.</p>
