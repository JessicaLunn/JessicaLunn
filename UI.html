    <h2> Jack Simms Software Engineering Portfolio </h2>
    <p>A recent Software Engineering graduate reached out to me, he explained he was terrible at creating good visual software and really liked my artwork. I collabratorated with him on the design on a new portfolio site, aiming to effectively communicate his personality and skillset to employers. Through this collabration I utilised my illstutration skills in animation and started learning Figma to prototype the website, so that he could code it to the design guidelines i produced. His only requirements was that he wanted bananas to feature as he had utilised their symbolisism in his recent conference talk.</p>
