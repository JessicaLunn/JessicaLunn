    <p>Struggling to find a career in traditional illustration roles, I realised I needed to upskill. I had previously completed a Udemy course in basic HTML and CSS as I was interested in creating a portfolio website to display my artwork. After helping a recent graduate design a better looking and more engaging website, I discovered a passion for designing beautiful, user friendly websites and I am now actively seeking full-time roles as a UI/UX Developer to further develop my skills and gain industry lead experience in the field.</p>

    <h2> Jack Simms Software Engineering Portfolio </h2>
    <p>My first project which got me hooked into Web Design started when a recent Software Engineering graduate reached out to me, explaining he was terrible at creating good visual software and really liked my artwork showcased on my Instagram. I collabratorated with him on the design on a new portfolio site, aiming to effectively communicate his personality and skillset to employers. Through this collabration I utilised my illstutration skills in animation and started learning Figma to prototype the website, so that he could code it to the design guidelines i produced. His only requirements was that he wanted bananas to feature as he had utilised their symbolisism in his recent conference talk.</p>

    <h2>Little Lemon Restaurant (Meta Course Project)</h2>
    <p>After the furfilling experience of helping with the design of Jack Simms's new portfolio, I decided to undertake a course to learn more about UI/UX design. I signed up for a course taught by Meta (Facebook) and achieved 100% in my coursework and 91% overall, gaining a certifcate accredited by Meta in "course name"</p>
    <p>My coursework task was to design a mobile app for a restraunt, to which I was given a specification and requirements of design:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="requirement">Requirement 1:</span> blah blah blah</li>
        <li><span class="requirement">Requirement 2:</span> More text here</li>
        <li><span class="requirement">Requirement 3:</span> Additional text</li>
      </ul>      
    </p>
    <p>I successfully completed this project within the given deadline, putting the knowledge gained from the seminars into practice, increasing my confidence and ability with Figma and UI/UX concepts, including:
      - User Stories
      - Usability Testing
      - etc
