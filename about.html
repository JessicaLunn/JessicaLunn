      <p>I'm Jess, a creative spirit with an aspiration to shape the world of product and UI design. Since graduating from Arts University Bournemouth, my ventures into silversmithing, digital drawing, and textile arts have honed my keen eye for detail and design. With experience from the Bournemouth School, combined with expertise in Photoshop, Illustrator, and basic web design, Iâ€™m poised to blend traditional arts with the digital realm. Adventurous by nature, with hobbies like cold water swimming and foraging mushrooms, I bring a fresh, unconventional perspective to design challenges.</p>
